**Double-Check Critical Files:**
- [ ] `attached_assets/ceo-removebg-preview_1756016869408.png` (Sarah Johnson photo)
- [ ] `client/src/` folder contains all React components
- [ ] `server/` folder contains all backend code
- [ ] `vercel.json` is present and configured
- [ ] `api/index.ts` exists for serverless functions

### 5. Missing Files? No Problem!

If any files are missing from your download:

**Re-download:**
1. Go back to Replit
2. Refresh the page
3. Try downloading again

**Individual File Recovery:**
1. In Replit, open the specific file
2. Copy the content
3. Create the file locally and paste content

**Check Hidden Files:**
Some files might be hidden. In Replit:
1. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in file explorer
2. Toggle "Show hidden files"
3. Download again

### 6. File Size Expectations

**Typical Download Size:**
- **Compressed (zip)**: 50-100 MB
- **Extracted**: 200-500 MB (includes node_modules if present)

**Large Folders:**
- `node_modules/` - Can be deleted, will be reinstalled
- `client/node_modules/` - Can be deleted
- `.git/` - Contains version history

### 7. Upload to GitHub Preparation

**Before uploading to GitHub:**
1. Delete `node_modules/` folders (if present) to reduce size
2. Keep `package-lock.json` - this ensures exact dependency versions
3. Verify `attached_assets/` folder is included
4. Check that all documentation files are present

**GitHub Repository Setup:**
1. Create new repository on GitHub
2. Don't initialize with README (you have your own files)
3. Upload all files maintaining folder structure
4. Commit and push all files

- [ ] Source code ✅

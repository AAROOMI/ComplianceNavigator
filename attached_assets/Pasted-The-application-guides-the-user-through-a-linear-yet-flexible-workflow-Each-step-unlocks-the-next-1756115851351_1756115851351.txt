The application guides the user through a linear, yet flexible, workflow. Each step unlocks the next.

1. Project Setup
Create a new project. Define the organization's name, size, and scope (e.g., does it have ICS?).
The CISO logs in and creates a new implementation project.
2. Gap Assessment
An interactive questionnaire based on the 114 controls. Users answer "Yes," "No," or "Not Applicable" for each control.
The security team completes the assessment. The app instantly calculates a "Compliance Score."
3. Risk Assessment
Integrated risk matrix. For every "No" in the gap assessment, the app prompts the user to assess the risk (Likelihood x Impact).
The team assigns risk levels (High, Medium, Low) to each gap.
4. Roadmap Generation
The app auto-generates a prioritized task list. High-risk gaps become top-priority tasks with suggested deadlines.
The CISO reviews and approves the generated roadmap.
5. Policy Development
A "Policy Builder" with pre-built, editable templates for all required policies (e.g., Cybersecurity Policy, AUP, IRP).
The security team selects a template, customizes it with their organization's details, and submits it for approval.
6. Task Management
A Kanban-style board (To Do, In Progress, For Review, Done) for all implementation tasks. Tasks are assigned to specific users.
Department heads receive notifications and work on their assigned tasks (e.g., "Implement MFA for email").
7. Document Repository
A central, secure library for uploading and storing all evidence (e.g., signed policies, patch logs, training records).
Users upload documents as proof of task completion.
8. Training & Awareness
Built-in micro-learning modules. Interactive sessions on phishing, secure browsing, and social media. Includes quizzes with scoring.
All employees log in to complete their mandatory training. Their competency is tracked.
9. Continuous Monitoring
A live dashboard showing real-time progress, compliance score, open tasks, and training completion rates.
The CISO uses the dashboard to monitor the entire organization's status.
10. Audit & Reporting
One-click generation of a formal compliance report for the NCA, including all evidence and assessment results.
The CISO generates the final report for submission.

3. Pre-Built, Well-Drafted Documentation Templates
The application comes with a library of pre-built, professionally formatted templates that are fully compliant with the ECC. These are editable within the app.

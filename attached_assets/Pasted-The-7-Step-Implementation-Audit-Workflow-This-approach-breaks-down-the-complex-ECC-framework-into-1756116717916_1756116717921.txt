The 7-Step Implementation & Audit Workflow
This approach breaks down the complex ECC framework into a manageable, phased process.

Step 1: Establish the Foundation (Governance & Commitment)
Objective: Secure leadership buy-in and create the organizational structure to lead the effort.
Key Activities:
Engage the Authorizing Official (AO): Present the ECC document and the Royal Decree (57231) to the CEO or head of the organization. Secure their formal commitment and approval to implement the controls.
Establish the Cybersecurity Function: Create a dedicated cybersecurity team (e.g., CISO office) as mandated by Control 1-2-1. Ensure it is independent from the IT department.
Form the Cybersecurity Steering Committee: As per Control 1-2-3, establish a committee with senior leaders (IT, HR, Legal, Operations) to provide oversight and support.
Conduct a Gap Analysis: Perform a high-level assessment to understand the organization's current state against the 114 ECC controls. This will identify major areas of weakness and prioritize efforts.
Deliverables: Approved project charter, Organizational chart for the cybersecurity function, Charter for the Steering Committee, Initial Gap Analysis Report.
Why Start Here? Without leadership support and a dedicated team, any security initiative will fail. This step ensures the necessary authority and resources are in place.
Step 2: Develop Core Policies & Define Roles (Governance & HR)
Objective: Create the foundational documents and assign responsibility for security.
Key Activities:
Define the Cybersecurity Strategy: Draft a high-level strategy (Control 1-1-1) aligned with the organization's goals and national regulations.
Develop Core Policies: Create the mandatory policies as per Control 1-3-1:
Cybersecurity Policy: The overarching document.
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP): For all technology assets (Control 2-1-3).
Information Classification Policy: To define how data is labeled and handled (Control 2-7-3-2).
Incident Response Plan (IRP): For managing breaches (Control 2-13-3-1).
Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) Plan: Incorporating cybersecurity resilience (Control 3-1-3-3).
Define Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly document who is responsible for what (Control 1-4-1). This includes the CISO, IT staff, department heads, and every employee.
Update HR Processes: Ensure employment contracts include cybersecurity responsibilities and non-disclosure agreements (Control 1-9-3-1). Define procedures for access revocation upon termination (Control 1-9-5).
Deliverables: Approved Cybersecurity Strategy, Approved Core Policies (Cybersecurity, AUP, Classification, IRP, BC/DR), Documented Roles and Responsibilities, Updated HR onboarding/offboarding procedures.
Why Next? Policies provide the "rules of the road." Defining roles ensures everyone knows their part in maintaining security.

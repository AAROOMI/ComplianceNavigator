Step 4: Implement Monitoring, Response & Awareness (Defense & Awareness)
Objective: Detect threats, respond to incidents, and empower employees.
Key Activities:
Enable Logging and Monitoring: Activate event logs on all critical systems and privileged accounts. Implement a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system for centralized monitoring (Controls 2-12-3-1, 2-12-3-3). Ensure logs are retained for at least 12 months (Control 2-12-3-5).
Implement Vulnerability Management: Conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests (Controls 2-10-3-1, 2-11-3-2). Establish a process to remediate findings based on risk.
Launch the Awareness Program: As per Control 1-10, develop and deliver engaging training. Focus on real-world threats like phishing, secure browsing, and mobile device security (Controls 1-10-3-1 to 1-10-3-4). Conduct regular phishing simulations.
Activate the Incident Response Plan: Ensure the IRP is communicated and that a response team is ready. Practice tabletop exercises.
Deliverables: Active SIEM dashboard, Vulnerability scan reports with remediation plans, Ongoing security awareness training program, Conducted phishing simulations, Tested Incident Response Plan.
Why Next? You can't protect what you can't see. This step ensures you can detect attacks and that your people are your first line of defense.
Step 5: Address Specialized Areas (Third-Party & ICS)
Objective: Extend security to external partners and specialized systems.
Key Activities:
Review Third-Party Contracts: Ensure all contracts with vendors and cloud providers include the required cybersecurity clauses (Control 4-1-2). Conduct risk assessments before signing (Control 4-1-3-1).
Ensure Cloud Compliance: Verify that any cloud-hosted data is stored within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and that environments are properly isolated (Control 4-2-3-3, 4-2-3-2).
Secure Industrial Control Systems (ICS): If applicable, implement strict network segmentation between ICS and corporate networks, limit the use of external media, and conduct specialized patch management (Controls 5-1-3-1, 5-1-3-5, 5-1-3-9).
Deliverables: Updated third-party contracts with security clauses, Cloud compliance assessment report, ICS security plan (if applicable).
Why Last? These areas are often more complex and require coordination with external parties or specialized expertise. They are built upon the strong foundation established in the previous steps.
